"""Application configuration.

One flat, validated settings object, loaded from `.env` (see `.env.example`
for the full list of overridable keys). Fields are grouped below by which
part of the pipeline they configure:

    1. Paths & environment          -- where things live on disk
    2. Signature detection (YOLO)   -- app/services/signature_detection.py
    3. Date field location (OCR)    -- app/services/date_extraction.py
    4. Digit classifier             -- app/services/digit_classifier.py
    5. Preprocessing                -- app/services/preprocessing.py
    6. Legacy single-cheque mode    -- app/main.py (Upload/ folder + one CSV)
    7. Batch ZIP ingestion          -- run.py, app/ingestion.py, app/manifest.py
    8. Worker process sizing        -- run.py's ProcessPoolExecutor

Every field can be overridden by an environment variable of the same name
(case-insensitive), or by editing `.env`. See `.env.example` for a laptop-safe
starting point.
